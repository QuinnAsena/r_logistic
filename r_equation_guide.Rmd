##### __Equation Guide__

* $N$ is the population at a given time-step (t)  
* $r_d$ is the descrete growth factor. 
    * $r=0$ is no growth
    * $r>0$ is positive growth 
    * $r<0$ is negative growth
* $K$ is the carrying capacity


##### __Limit Cycles and Chaos__
* $r_d < 2.000$ population reaches $K$ with dampening oscillations
* $2.000 < r_d < 2.449$: two point stable limit cycle
* $2.449 < r_d < 2.570$: limit cycle increase geometrically (2, 4, 6, 8...)
* $r_d > 2.570$: aperiodic (irregular) patterns known as chaos.
